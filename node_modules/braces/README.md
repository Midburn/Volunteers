> Fast, comprehensive, bash-like brace expansion implemented in JavaScript. Complete support for the Bash 4.3 braces specification, without sacrificing speed.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save braces
```

## Usage

The main export is a function that takes a brace `pattern` to expand and an `options` object if necessary.

```js
var braces = require('braces');
braces(pattern[, options]);
```

## Highlights

* **Safer**: Braces isn't [vulnerable to DoS attacks](#braces-is-safe), unlike [brace-expansion](https://github.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion), [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) and [multimatch](https://github.com/sindresorhus/multimatch) (this not the same [DoS bug](https://medium.com/node-security/minimatch-redos-vulnerability-590da24e6d3c#.jew0b6mpc) that was found in minimatch and multimatch recently)
* **Accurate**: complete support for the [Bash 4.3 Brace Expansion](www.gnu.org/software/bash/) specification (passes all of the Bash braces tests)
* **[fast and performant](#benchmarks)**: not only runs fast, but scales well as patterns increase in complexity (other libs don't - see the notes on [performance](#performance)).
* **Organized code base**: with parser and compiler that are easy to maintain and update when edge cases crop up.
* **Well-tested**: 900+ unit tests with thousands of actual patterns tested. Passes 100% of the [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) and [brace-expansion](https://github.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion) unit tests as well.
* **Optimized braces**: By default returns an optimized string that can be used for creating regular expressions for matching.
* **Expanded braces**: Optionally returns an array (like bash). See a [comparison](#optimized-vs-expanded) between optimized and expanded.

**Optimized**

Patterns are optimized for regex and matching by default:

```js
console.log(braces('a/{x,y,z}/b'));
//=> ['a/(x|y|z)/b']
```

**Expanded**

To expand patterns the same way as Bash or [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch), use the [.expand](#expand) method:

```js
console.log(braces.expand('a/{x,y,z}/b'));
//=> ['a/x/b', 'a/y/b', 'a/z/b']
```

## Features

* [lists](#lists): Supports "lists": `a/{b,c}/d` => `['a/b/d', 'a/c/d']`
* [sequences](#sequences): Supports alphabetical or numerical "sequences" (ranges): `{1..3}` => `['1', '2', '3']`
* [steps](#steps): Supports "steps" or increments: `{2..10..2}` => `['2', '4', '6', '8', '10']`
* [escaping](#escaping)
* [options](#options)

### Lists

Uses [fill-range](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/fill-range) for expanding alphabetical or numeric lists:

```js
console.log(braces('a/{foo,bar,baz}/*.js'));
//=> ['a/(foo|bar|baz)/*.js']

console.log(braces.expand('a/{foo,bar,baz}/*.js'));
//=> ['a/foo/*.js', 'a/bar/*.js', 'a/baz/*.js']
```

### Sequences

Uses [fill-range](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/fill-range) for expanding alphabetical or numeric ranges (bash "sequences"):

```js
// padding is not retained when string is optimized
console.log(braces('a{01..03}b')); // ['a([1-3])b']
console.log(braces('a{1..3}b'));   // ['a([1-3])b']

console.log(braces.expand('{1..3}'));     // ['1', '2', '3']
console.log(braces.expand('a{01..03}b')); // ['a01b', 'a02b', 'a03b']
console.log(braces.expand('a{1..3}b'));   // ['a1b', 'a2b', 'a3b']
console.log(braces.expand('{a..c}'));     // ['a', 'b', 'c']
console.log(braces.expand('foo/{a..c}')); // ['foo/a', 'foo/b', 'foo/c']
```

### Steps

Steps, or increments, may be used with ranges:

```js
console.log(braces.expand('{2..10..2}'));
//=> ['2', '4', '6', '8', '10']

console.log(braces('{2..10..2}'));
//=> ['(2|4|6|8|10)']
```

When the [.optimize](#optimize) method is used, or [options.optimize](#optionsoptimize) is set to true, sequences are passed to [to-regex-range](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/to-regex-range) for expansion.

### Nesting

Brace patterns may be nested. The results of each expanded string are not sorted, and left to right order is preserved.

**"Expanded" examples**

```js
console.log(braces.expand('a{b,c,/{x,y}}/e'));
//=> ['ab/e', 'ac/e', 'a/x/e', 'a/y/e']

console.log(braces.expand('a/{x,{1..5},y}/c'));
//=> ['a/x/c', 'a/1/c', 'a/2/c', 'a/3/c', 'a/4/c', 'a/5/c', 'a/y/c']
```

**"Optimized" examples**

```js
console.log(braces('a{b,c,/{x,y}}/e'));
//=> ['a(b|c|/(x|y))/e']

console.log(braces('a/{x,{1..5},y}/c'));
//=> ['a/(x|([1-5])|y)/c']
```

### Escaping

**Escaping braces**

Prevent braces from being expanded or evaluted by escaping either the opening or closing brace:

```js
console.log(braces.expand('a\\{d,c,b}e'));
//=> ['a{d,c,b}e']

console.log(braces.expand('a{d,c,b\\}e'));
//=> ['a{d,c,b}e']
```

**Escaping commas**

Commas inside braces may also be escaped:

```js
console.log(braces.expand('a{d\\,c,b}e'));
//=> ['ad,ce', 'abe']
```

**Single items**

A brace pattern is also considered to be escaped when it contains a single item:

```js
console.log(braces.expand('a{b}c'));
//=> ['a{b}c']

console.log(braces.expand('a{b\\,c}d'));
//=> ['a{b,c}d']
```

## Options

### options.expand

Type: `Boolean`

Default: `undefined`

Generate an "expanded" brace pattern (this option is unncessary with the `.expand` method, which does the same thing).

```js
console.log(braces('a/{b,c}/d', {expand: true}));
//=> [ 'a/b/d', 'a/c/d' ]
```

### options.optimize

Type: `Boolean`

Default: `true`

Enabled by default.

```js
console.log(braces('a/{b,c}/d'));
//=> [ 'a/(b|c)/d' ]
```

### options.nodupes

Type: `Boolean`

Default: `true`

Duplicates are removed by default. To keep duplicates, pass `{nodupes: false}` on the options

### options.rangeLimit

Type: `Number`

Default: `250`

When `braces.expand()` is used, or `options.expand` is true, brace patterns will automatically be [optimized](#optionsoptimize) when the difference between the range minimum and range maximum exceeds the `rangeLimit`. This is to prevent huge ranges from freezing your application.

You can set this to any number, or change `options.rangeLimit` to `Inifinity` to disable this altogether.

**Examples**

```js
// pattern exceeds the "rangeLimit", so it's optimized automatically
console.log(braces.expand('{1..1000}'));
//=> ['([1-9]|[1-9][0-9]{1,2}|1000)']

// pattern does not exceed "rangeLimit", so it's NOT optimized
console.log(braces.expand('{1..100}'));
//=> ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', '24', '25', '26', '27', '28', '29', '30', '31', '32', '33', '34', '35', '36', '37', '38', '39', '40', '41', '42', '43', '44', '45', '46', '47', '48', '49', '50', '51', '52', '53', '54', '55', '56', '57', '58', '59', '60', '61', '62', '63', '64', '65', '66', '67', '68', '69', '70', '71', '72', '73', '74', '75', '76', '77', '78', '79', '80', '81', '82', '83', '84', '85', '86', '87', '88', '89', '90', '91', '92', '93', '94', '95', '96', '97', '98', '99', '100']
```

### options.transform

Type: `Function`

Default: `undefined`

Customize range expansion.

```js
var range = braces.expand('x{a..e}y', {
  transform: function(str) {
    return 'foo' + str;
  }
});

console.log(range);
//=> [ 'xfooay', 'xfooby', 'xfoocy', 'xfoody', 'xfooey' ]
```

### options.quantifiers

Type: `Boolean`

Default: `undefined`

In regular expressions, quanitifiers can be used to specify how many times a token can be repeated. For example, `a{1,3}` will match the letter `a` one to three times.

Unfortunately, regex quantifiers happen to share the same syntax as [Bash lists](#lists)

The `quantifiers` option tells braces to detect when [regex quantifiers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp#quantifiers) are defined in the given pattern, and not to try to expand them as lists.

**Examples**

```js
var braces = require('braces');
console.log(braces('a/b{1,3}/{x,y,z}'));
//=> [ 'a/b(1|3)/(x|y|z)' ]
console.log(braces('a/b{1,3}/{x,y,z}', {quantifiers: true}));
//=> [ 'a/b{1,3}/(x|y|z)' ]
console.log(braces('a/b{1,3}/{x,y,z}', {quantifiers: true, expand: true}));
//=> [ 'a/b{1,3}/x', 'a/b{1,3}/y', 'a/b{1,3}/z' ]
```

## Performance

### What's the big deal?

If you use globbing a lot, whether in your build tool chain or in your application, the speed of the glob matcher not only impacts your experience, but a slow glob matcher can slow everything else down, limitimg what you thought was possible in your application.

### Braces is fast

> minimatch gets exponentially slower as patterns increase in complexity, braces does not

Brace patterns are meant to be expanded - at least, if you're using Bash, that is. It's not at all unusual for users to want to use brace patterns for dates or similar ranges. It's also very easy to define a brace pattern that appears to be very simple but in fact is fairly complex.

For example, here is how generated regex size and processing time compare as patterns increase in complexity:

_(the following results were generated using `braces()` and `minimatch.braceExpand()`)_

| **Pattern** | **minimatch** | **braces** | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{1..9007199254740991}`<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> | N/A (freezes) | `300 B` (12ms 878μs) |
| `{1..10000000}` | `98.9 MB` (20s 193ms 13μs) | `34 B` (11ms 204μs) |
| `{1..1000000}` | `8.89 MB` (1s 838ms 718μs) | `33 B` (1ms 761μs) |
| `{1..100000}` | `789 kB` (181ms 518μs) | `32 B` (1ms 76μs) |
| `{1..10000}` | `68.9 kB` (17ms 436μs) | `31 B` (1ms 382μs) |
| `{1..1000}` | `5.89 kB` (1ms 773μs) | `30 B` (1ms 509μs) |
| `{1..100}` | `491 B` (321μs) | `24 B` (309μs) |
| `{1..10}` | `40 B` (56μs) | `12 B` (333μs) |
| `{1..3}` | `11 B` (80μs) | `9 B` (370μs) |

These numbers are actually pretty small as far as numeric ranges are concerned. Regardless, we shouldn't have to consider such things when creating a glob pattern. The tool should get out of your way and let you be as creative as you want.

### Braces is performant

Even when brace patterns are fully **expanded**, `braces` is still much faster.

_(the following results were generated using `braces.expand()` and `minimatch.braceExpand()`)_

| **Pattern** | **minimatch** | **braces** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `a/{1..10000000}` | `98.9 MB` (19s 754ms 376μs) | `98.9 MB` (5s 734ms 419μs) |
| `a/{1..1000000}` | `8.89 MB` (1s 866ms 968μs) | `8.89 MB` (561ms 594μs) |
| `a/{1..100000}` | `789 kB` (178ms 311μs) | `789 kB` (29ms 823μs) |
| `a/{1..10000}` | `68.9 kB` (17ms 692μs) | `68.9 kB` (2ms 351μs) |
| `a/{1..1000}` | `5.89 kB` (1ms 823μs) | `5.89 kB` (706μs) |
| `a/{1..100}` | `491 B` (609μs) | `491 B` (267μs) |
| `a/{1..10}` | `40 B` (61μs) | `40 B` (636μs) |
| `a/{1..3}` | `11 B` (206μs) | `11 B` (207μs) |

### Why is braces so fast?

Braces was built from the ground up to be as performant as possible when matching, using a combination of the following:

* **minimizes loops and iterating**: we try to pass over the pattern once to parse it before passing it to the compiler.
* **generates an optimized string**: sequences/ranges are optimized by [to-regex-range](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/to-regex-range), which is not only highly accurate, but produces patterns that are a fraction of the size of patterns generated by other brace expansion libraries, such as Bash and [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) (via [brace-expansion](https://github.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion))
* **generates results faster**: can handle even the most complex patterns that cause other implementations like [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) and Bash to fail.

### Braces is safe

Last, but perhaps most important of all, unlike [brace-expansion](https://github.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion) and [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch), braces will not freeze your application when a user passes a complex brace pattern.

**The trouble with ~~tribbles~~ brace patterns**

There are unlimited scenarios where brace patterns cause the resulting array to grow geometrically. If you define two brace patterns for example, the result is multiplicative if not exponential. For example, given the pattern `{1..1000}`, we would end up with 1 thousand strings. But if two patterns are given, such as `{1...1000}{1...1000}`, we would end up with 1 million strings.

It's easy to think, "I wouldn't do that", but that's not the point. Even though those example patterns are contrived:

1. it's not uncommon for users to define brace patterns that result in similarly huge strings (consider date ranges `1-2016`, for example, and how easy it might be for someone to also add an alphabetical range if searching records of some kind)
2. we can't control how users define their patterns (and we shouldn't have to care)
3. even if it's uncommon for user to define unwieldy patterns, there is still potential for intentionally exploiting this feature to [cause a DoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) in your application (and given that this is a not-very-technically-advanced method for causing a DoS - e.g. anyone can do it, you should be concerned!)

**Potential for DoS attacks**

Most brace expansion libraries, including Bash, [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch), [multimatch](https://github.com/sindresorhus/multimatch) and [brace-expansion](https://github.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion) are vulnerable to DoS attacks (similar to the [ReDoS bug](https://medium.com/node-security/minimatch-redos-vulnerability-590da24e6d3c#.jew0b6mpc) minimatch had recently).

Braces mitigates this risk in three ways:

1. Braces prevents malicious strings from being used by checking the length of the input strings, as well as generated regex
2. Braces [optimizes](#optimize) the generated result by default, so that only _one output string is generated for every input string_.
3. When [.expand](#expand) or [options.expand](#optionsexpand) are used, braces has checks in place to prevent huge ranges from being (accidentally) created. By default, when more than 250 strings will result from the given pattern, braces will [optimize](#optimize) the result instead of expanding it. You can override this limit of 250 by passing a custom number on [options.rangeLimit](#optionsrangelimit).

_(you might also want to consider using [micromatch](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/micromatch) for glob matching, as a safer alternative to minimatch and multimatch)_
